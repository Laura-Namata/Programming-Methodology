#Section 1.1 Introduction

#Forecasting stock prices has been a challenging task due to the inherent uncertainty and complexity of financial markets. There is prominence in use of mathematical models to predict stock prices. This term paper focuses on employing the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model as a forecasting tool specifically for East African Breweries Limited (EABL). By utilizing the GBM model, we aim to explore its effectiveness in predicting the future stock prices of this company.

#The objectives of this term paper are as follows. Firstly, we aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Geometric Brownian Motion model and the methodology we shall use. By establishing a clear foundation, readers will gain an understanding of how the GBM model can capture the stochastic and random movements observed in stock prices.
#Secondly, we will delve into the specific application of the GBM model to East African Breweries Limited. We will analyse historical stock price data to build a reliable forecasting framework. Through this case study, we intend to evaluate the model's effectiveness in predicting the future stock prices of East African Breweries Limited.Thirdly, we will address the accuracy of the predictions associated with the GBM model when applied to East African Breweries Limited.
